### Servlets:

Servlet is a server-side technology which is used to handle the client request, process the request, and generate the dynamic response.

#### Client Means:
- Browser like Firefox, Brave, Chrome

#### Server Means:
- It is the software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network by the client.

#### Types of Servers:
1. Web
   - Apache Tomcat
   - GlassFish
   - Jetty

2. Application
   - JBoss
   - WebLogic
   - IBM WebSphere

When we use Apache Tomcat server, it has this container:
- Servlet
- JSP
- Security
- WebSocket
- JNDI

So, when a client sends the request, the file/servlet class is made/deployed upon the Apache Tomcat server into the servlet container which manages and checks the request of the client and produces the dynamic request. Here, we are using servlet for dynamic response as it also gives static response very nicely.

Other server-side technologies are:
- JSP
- Spring Boot
- Spring
- JSF
- Stats
- PHP
- Python
